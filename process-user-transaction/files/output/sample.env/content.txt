Toby loved his bicycle more than anything else he owned. It wasnt new, nor was it flashyit was a hand-me-down from his older brother, its red paint chipped in places and the handlebars wrapped in mismatched tape. But to Toby, it wasnt just a bike; it was freedom.

Every afternoon after school, Toby would race out of the house, hop on his bike, and pedal down the winding dirt road behind his neighborhood. The road led to a hidden meadow, a place only Toby seemed to know about. There, hed spend hours exploring, imagining himself as an adventurer on a great expedition. His bike wasnt just transportationit was his trusty steed, carrying him through jungles, deserts, and mountains.
